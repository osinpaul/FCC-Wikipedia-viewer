Welcome to the FreeCodeCamp: search the wikipedia app!

This is my third project.... and it's awesome! I very satisfied all my work :)
This App uses Wikipedia API, that recieve JSON object after GET requsting to the server.
GET request include number of entries, user query and other stuff.

My App follow the next user stories:

+ User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

+ User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.


You can try it yourself on the demo page: osinpaul.ru/projects/wikiView

Good luck!
